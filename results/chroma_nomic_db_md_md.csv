What are the 3 key steps for enriching data with organisation entities?,"The three key steps for enriching data with organisation entities are:

1. Analysis of specific metadata fields containing providers' information in the source data, followed by the selection of potential organisation entities to enrich the source metadata.
2. Automatically matching provided data in the source fields with the entity.
3. Replacement of source data with the entity and inclusion of the entity as a “foaf:Organization” contextual class within the record.

These steps are part of a larger process called semantic enrichment, which involves establishing meaningful connections between values in source metadata fields and predefined reference points (target fields) to enrich the data with organisation entities.","1. Analysis of specific metadata fields containing provider's imformation in the source data, followed by the selection of potential organisation entities to enrich the source metadata. 2.

What is the definition of a Literal?,"Unfortunately, this JSON-LD schema doesn't provide a specific definition for the term ""Literal"". However, based on the context and other metadata-related standards, I can offer some information.

In metadata and RDF (Resource Description Framework) terminology, a Literal is a type of value that represents a plain text or numerical value without any additional semantic meaning. Literals are often used to represent data values such as numbers, dates, times, and strings.

Examples of literals include:

* Numbers: ""42"", ""-3.14""
* Dates: ""2022-07-25"", ""1955-01-01T12:00:00Z""
* Times: ""14:30:00"", ""23:59:59""

In contrast, other values like references to resources (e.g., URLs), semantic tags (e.g., VIAF or AAT terms), and literals with additional context (e.g., language codes) are considered different types of values.

If you have any further questions or need more clarification, please feel free to ask!","A string value with an optional language tag (taken from ISO639), represented in RDF/XML using the xml:lang attribute. (RDF terminology)"
